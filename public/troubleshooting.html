      <h3>
        The URLs on the navbar aren't
        working
      </h3>
      <p>
        If the URLs aren't working, it
        probably means that your offline
        or your internet connection is
        poor. It also might mean that
        the URL worked but is taking
        a long time to redirect. 
        If your browser has a loading 
        bar, you can look at the progress
      </p>
      <h3>
        The website is taking a very
        long time to load
        (over 8 seconds)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If it's taking a long time to
        load, it can mean that your
        internet connection is poor
        or it's your first time on the
        site and the browser hasn't
        cached the site properly. It
        can also mean that the website
        itself is becoming slow. To fix
        this, you can try refreshing the
        page to make the browser cache
        and you can try adding the 
        website as a app. Depending on
        your browser, there should be
        a "add to home screen" option
        that will add the website as an
        app which will give you faster
        performance
      </p>
      <h3>
        The game isn't working
        (stuck on black screen)
      </h3>
      <p>
        If the game is stuck on a 
        black screen, that means that
        the code isn't compatible with
        your browser or device. To fix
        this, update your device or
        browser. If that still doesn't 
        work, it can mean that your
        browser is old or faulty. Try
        using modern browsers such as
        Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
        If that doesn't work, try
        powering your device on and
        off and checking your internet
        connection. If none of the
        above works, it can mean that
        the game isn't supported in your
        device
